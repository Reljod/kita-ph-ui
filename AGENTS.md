# AGENTS.md — Kita PH UI

This file is the operating charter for any agent working in this repository —
Claude Code, a Claude Agent SDK process, or any other AGENTS.md-compatible
tool. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file: one charter, read by every
runtime.

## What this repo is

Next.js 16 + React 19 web client for the Kita ecosystem, talking to Kita API.

## Operating principles

1. **Act decisively where the call is clearly yours.** Prefer well-reasoned
   action over hedged options; escalate the genuinely ambiguous decisions
   instead of guessing.
2. **System of record over ad hoc storage.** Keep each kind of information
   where it actually belongs (tasks in the tracker, docs in the docs, code
   in the repo) rather than scattering shadow copies.
3. **Reversible by default.** Local, reversible actions (drafting, editing,
   reading) don't need a check-in. Anything hard to reverse or visible to
   others — sending messages, pushing to shared branches, closing tickets —
   gets confirmed first.
4. **Extend by writing it down.** Capture what proves itself in the smallest
   durable form: a one-line WHY note under **Design choices** below, or — for
   a repeatable, multi-step procedure — a skill under `.agents/skills/`. Ad
   hoc fixes that never get written down don't compound.
5. **Keep this file thin.** This charter holds identity, principles, and slim
   WHY notes. Operational how-to lives in the skill that owns it; deep
   area-specific procedure in its own linked doc. Not here.

## Design choices (the WHYs)

Slim notes on decisions worth not re-litigating, so the reasoning outlives
the session that set it. Add a line when a choice proves itself; distill it,
don't narrate it.

- **Quality by layering, not diligence.** Cheap deterministic checks early
  under mandatory ones later beats relying on remembering to be careful (see
  the layer model below).
- **E2E starts Next itself, not via playwright's `webServer`.** That hook
  runs before `globalSetup`, so the API proxy would come up with empty
  credentials. → **`run-e2e`**
- **Only drop what this process created.** Against a deployed API the
  cluster belongs to the deployment; teardown skips the drop rather than
  deleting data it does not own. → **`run-e2e`**
- **Never `pkill` in this environment.** The pattern matches the shell
  running it, so the session dies with an empty log and a confusing exit
  code. Probe ports and kill by recorded pid. → **`run-e2e`**
- **This sandbox has HTTPS egress only.** Mongo Atlas `:27017` is
  unreachable here while `:443` works, so a Mongo timeout is the network,
  not the credentials.
- **A local lint gate has to match CI's scope, not just its command.**
  `pre-commit` sees only staged files; CI lints everything the branch
  touches relative to `main`. A file already clean when it was staged still
  fails CI, which is how a green local commit produced a red PR. `pre-push`
  runs the same commands over the same branch-wide diff.
  → **`setup-git-hooks`**
- _Add your project's WHYs here as they emerge._

## How code quality is enforced (the layer model)

Quality comes from layering cheap deterministic checks early with mandatory
ones later, so nothing depends on remembering to be careful:

1. **Local, fast, skippable** — git hooks catch typos, formatting, and
   malformed commit messages in under a second. Bypassable; never the real
   gate. → **`setup-git-hooks`**
2. **Server-side, slower, mandatory** — branch protection + required CI
   checks + required reviewers. This is where "tests must pass" and coverage
   thresholds actually bite.
3. **Continuous, not per-PR** — heavier suites (E2E, fuzzing) on a schedule;
   they open a ticket, they don't block a merge.
4. **Upstream of code** — a short behavior list before non-trivial work, so
   "did we build the right thing" is answered before the code exists.
   → **`tdd-loop`**

## Branching

Feature branches only, never directly on `main`. Names follow
`claude/<short-description>-<id>` for agent-driven work.

## Commits

```
<type>: <TICKET> <subject>
```

- `type` ∈ feat, fix, bug, chore, docs, refactor, test, perf, ci, build,
  style, revert.
- `TICKET` is the issue key (e.g. `JOD-12`), required except
  for housekeeping types (chore/docs/style/ci).
- Keep the subject imperative and ≤ 72 chars.

Match whatever `setup-git-hooks` installs for this repo. → **`setup-git-hooks`**

## PRs

Draft by default; open one after pushing if no open PR exists for the
branch. Build the body with **`create-pr`** — visuals first, and surface
that the deterministic checks are green so review attention goes to
judgment, not to re-verifying the boring correctness.

## Skills

Reusable skills live under `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, each with
a thin slash-command wrapper in `.claude/commands/`. Invoke either the
command or the skill directly. Promote a new skill here once a behavior has
proven itself more than once.
